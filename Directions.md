Step 1: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.


Step 2: Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

Step 3: Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. 

Step 4: Place crepe on a plate, and add nutella on top. Spread to all sides, and once done, fold in half. Fold in half again. Serve hot.
